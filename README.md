# Not a real CTF

since the ancient times, since when DDOS has existed, since when someone came up with the idea of CTFs ... m a  n   y     t     h    i   n  g s     h a  v   e      h       a      p     p     e   n  n  e d!

THE MAIN PROBLEM! MY FRIEND ARNUB!

is that people are stupid... they will waste atleast 1 hour 17 minutes and 36 seconds during a CTF, downloading files and then moving them around their file system ,., sayS NOT ME! BUT A 2019 statistics by @invalid-user in discord! This person took live samples during the following CTFs... ABCCTF ( A BIG CTF CTF), 1337x99999CTF, R-18CTF and CTFNASA! 

**Notable results kudos to him:**
> 87.51% of CTfeRS click on the file to download and then access it from their Downloads folder!

> 39.29%, yes @naughtyb0y I am pointing at you! don't even make a folder DEDICATED for the CTF!

> 6.94% actually use `wget`, CHEERS!

> 26.11% n00bs create folders like CTF_LOVECON_2K20, can you believe it folks????

> 15.73% use `curl` and fail, ^wtf^

(results are not-independent; venn diagrams predicted to be messy; contact - prof. ocip)

# The real stuff \#
