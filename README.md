>beware of Python2.7, hosters!

since the ancient times, since when DDOS has existed, since when someone came up with the idea of CTFs...

CTFers have shown stupidity and will continue... they will waste atleast 1 hour 17 minutes and 36 seconds during a CTF, downloading files and then moving them around their file system ,., sayS NOT ME! BUT A 2019 statistics by @invalid-user in discord! This person took live samples during the following CTFs... ABCCTF ( A BIG CTF CTF), 1337x99999CTF, R-18CTF and CTFNASA! 

**Notable results kudos to him:**
> 87.51% of CTfeRS click on the file to download and then access it from their Downloads folder!

> 39.29%, yes @naughtyb0y I am pointing at you! don't even make a folder DEDICATED for the CTF!

> 6.94% actually use `wget`, CHEERS!

> 26.11% n00bs create folders like CTF_LOVECON_2K20, can you believe it folks????

> 15.73% use `curl` and fail, ^wtf^

(results are not-independent; venn diagrams predicted to be messy; contact - prof. ocip)

## The real stuff 

So, to solve the above mentioned problem, I bring to you the Ultimate CTF Vaccuum Cleaner or was it Scraper? Anyway... if you weren't offended by any of this feel free to continue...

**What do we have going here?**

*-->* this cli will helps scrape all the challenges in your favorite CTF and organize them into your defined folder as per the challenge categories!

*-->* you have the control of downloading all or none, or category-wise, the files that come with a challenges! If you choose `None`, you will have all the challenge description atleast with you!

*-->* Scraping is just the tip of things, we have also provided a **free** *FLAG Submitter* for our open-source customers! If you are not open-source, then what are you doing here? \*=?

*-->* Want more? Well, how about getting rid of the hassle of logining in again and again with new *session saves!* Register in one time and forget about the website entirely... hmm, sounds euphoric!

*-->* currently supports CTFd, CTFx and other platforms coming soon! Mostly because there aren't any to test on!

**DE-BENEFACTO**

need motivation for cloning this repo? read below:

*-->* It will save time (duh ðŸ¥´), especially when CTFs can been time-clinching sometimes!

*-->* CTFs generally update with the challenge description and files, and also add in new challeneges! Rather that scrounging through the slow website or missing an update notification, just run the scraper; it will update the files!!

*-->* With a good Internet connection, you can scrape everything within 10 seconds ðŸ¤¯

*-->* Make solving CTFs almost offline! Also many a time, flag-submitting is a hassle! The java-script behind responds weirdly and you just sit there not knowing whether your flag got submitted or not!

*-->* Help keep all the files in an organized manner, make write-ups or uploading the files to github!
